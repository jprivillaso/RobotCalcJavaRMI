RobotCalcJavaRMI
================

This is an stand alone application, which uses Java RMI as a middleware to invoke remote methods.
Also, it consumes a webservice that is in PHP and write the result of the call to the service in an
XML file.

The archives were supposed to be local, so you have to take care with the paths.
